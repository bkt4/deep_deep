Stable Diffusion is an open source, deep learning, text-to-image model AI art generator software released in 2022. It is primarily used to generate detailed images conditioned on text descriptions (text-to-image, "txt2img"), though it also has image-to-image ("img2img") features such as inpainting and outpainting. It can generate output in practically any artistic style as well as photorealistic images.
